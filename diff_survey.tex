\section{Introduction}\label{Intro}
A substantial amount of work has been done to uncover the
effects that individual differences have on visualization
interactions. The implications of this research are attractive
and far-reaching; with a profound understanding of this
relationship, we could design visualizations catered to a
person’s specific needs, and infer a person’s traits from
their interactions with electronic media.  However, this work
has been fairly limited in scope, and it has been difficult to
generalize their conclusions to higher level tasks. This paper
is a survey of the work that has been done to explore these
relationships, and the frameworks that have been used to
categorize them.
